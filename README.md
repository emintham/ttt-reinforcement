# TicTacToe Reinforcement Learning

Work with Python 3

## Instructions

* pip install -r requirements.py

## Description

* Main learning logic is in `v_learn.py`
* uses a V table as described in Chapter 1 of [this book](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book-2nd.html)
* Modification to randomly vary the first player -- achieves slightly better training.
* prints nice plots to visualize the learning
* add a `l.play()` after `l.train()` in `v_learn.py` to play against the bot
* play with various parameters in `v_learn.py` to see how strong/weak the bot gets
